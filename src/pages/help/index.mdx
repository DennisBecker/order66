# üõ∏ Order 66 Raid Analysis - Help Guide

<Card title="Getting Started" icon="üöÄ">
  Welcome to the Order 66 Raid Analysis tool! This application automatically analyzes your guild's raid performance based on CSV files exported from Wookiebot.

  ## Quick Start
  1. Export your raid data from Wookiebot as CSV files
  2. Name the files in the format `yyyy-mm-dd.csv` (e.g., `2025-07-23.csv`)
  3. Place your CSV files in the `data/` directory
  4. Run `npm run build` to process the data
  5. View your results in the dashboard

  ## File Naming Convention
  - **Format**: `yyyy-mm-dd.csv` (ISO date format)
  - **Examples**: 
    - `2025-07-23.csv` ‚úÖ
    - `2025-12-01.csv` ‚úÖ 
    - `raid-data.csv` ‚ùå (incorrect format)
    - `23-07-2025.csv` ‚ùå (wrong date format)
</Card>

  ## Key Metrics

  - **Participation %**: Percentage of raids a player has participated in
  - **Total Score**: Sum of all raid scores for a player
  - **Average Score**: Average score per raid (only counting participated raids)
  - **Trend**: Rising, Falling, or Stable based on recent performance

  ## Color Coding
  - üü¢ **Green**: Above average performance
  - üî¥ **Red**: Below average performance  
  - ‚ö´ **Gray**: Did not participate in that raid

  ## Expected CSV Structure
  Your Wookiebot CSV files should contain the following columns:

  ```csv
  "name","allycode","estimatedScore","lastActualScore","diff","diffPercent"
  "Player Name","123456789",4518000,2180000,-2338000,-51.7
  ```

  ### Column Descriptions
  - **name**: Player name in the guild
  - **allycode**: Unique player identifier
  - **estimatedScore**: Expected raid score based on roster
  - **lastActualScore**: Actual score achieved in the raid
  - **diff**: Difference between estimated and actual score
  - **diffPercent**: Percentage difference

  ## Data Processing
  - Files are automatically converted to JSON during the build process
  - Multiple raid dates are compared to show trends over time
  - Missing participation is tracked (0 scores indicate no participation)
